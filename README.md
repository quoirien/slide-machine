projectile psychotronics

This project is a simple in-browser environment to manage building psychotronic visuals (mainly intended for projection in live performance settings) on the fly.

To use, just open the index.html file in your browser of choice. I have good results with Chrome. I suspect for best performance, it would be good to run as little concurrently as possible, e.g. in Windows run in Safe Mode.

Documentation coming soon (ish).
